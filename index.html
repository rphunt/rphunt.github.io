	<h1>Github pages test with webpack</h1>

	<p>
		OK, I have a project folder, with /src and /dist.
	</p>
	<p>
		The prject folder has a git repo, and /dist has a separate repo, and a .gitignore that includes 'dist'. So the project folder will have a different github repo than the actual github pages. So I can work on the /src code, commit it and bundle it, then commit and push the /dist to the github pages separtely.
	</p>
	<p>
		The editor only needs the project folder. But I'll need 2 terminals, one for each repo.
	</p>
	<p>
		'gh-pages' is cool, but that won't work for this as far as I can tell.
